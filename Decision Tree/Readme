This is the first submission of the decision tree algorithm.
You can run the program by running the command:
python main.py "folder_to_data"

As of now there is support only to take input files, building the decision tree
and printing the first feature, the rest will be added in the following commits to come.
Code is well commented with meaningful variable names

Features to add-
1) Calculating and limiting the depth of the tree.
2) Add support for cross validation.
3) Option for changing the split criteria.
4) Calculation of the accuracy.

Enhancements-
Better input handling using numpy

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Part 2 -

Features Added -
1) Size of the decision tree
2) Stratified Cross Validation
3) Accuracy
4) Option for changing split criteria

Features remaining To Add -
1) Handling Continuous Features
2) Depth of the tree

Run the program by running the command:
python main.py "folder_to_data"

3 lines of output-
1st line is the first feature
2nd line is the accuracy
3rd line is the size of the decision tree

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Part 3 -

Features Added -
1) Handling Continuous Features
2) Depth of the tree


Run the program by running the command:
python main.py "folder_to_data" crossvalidation max_depth split_criteria

The names file should be in the following format-
Index:Values,Feature1:continuous,Feature2:values and so on.

It has to be mentioned that the feature is continuous.
